# *Begin*
 I find myself on the edge   
 Of a beginning  
 Of a journey, an idea, a steep drop    

 Into a consuming heat  
 Where throats are perpetually dry  
 And the key to water is lost 

 An iron grip holds me against my will   
 The vines green and alive  
 Pulling me, pushing me 

 And then thereâ€™s a liberating  
 Vivacious beat  
 That arouses a crazed dance from within  
 Moving to an enveloping sound  

 There I am  
 I find myself on the edge of freedom  
 On the verge of rectification  
 On the end of that journey, idea, steep drop  

 And I find myself  
 Feeling gratitude towards the experience  
 For it has made me voracious  
 To be on that edge  
 Of the beginning
