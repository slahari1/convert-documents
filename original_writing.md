# *Begin*
- I find myself on the edge  
- Of a beginning  
- Of a journey, an idea, a steep drop  
{:.verse}
- Into a consuming heat  
- Where throats are perpetually dry  
- And the key to water is lost 
{:.verse}
- An iron grip holds me against my will   
- The vines green and alive  
- Pulling me, pushing me 
{:.verse}
- And then thereâ€™s a liberating  
- Vivacious beat  
- That arouses a crazed dance from within  
- Moving to an enveloping sound  
{:.verse}
- There I am  
- I find myself on the edge of freedom  
- On the verge of rectification  
- On the end of that journey, idea, steep drop  
{:.verse}
- And I find myself  
- Feeling gratitude towards the experience  
- For it has made me voracious  
- to be on that edge  
- Of the beginning
