<h1 id="begin"><em>Begin</em></h1>
<p>I find myself on the edge<br /> Of a beginning<br /> Of a journey, an idea, a steep drop</p>
<p>Into a consuming heat<br /> Where throats are perpetually dry<br /> And the key to water is lost</p>
<p>An iron grip holds me against my will<br /> The vines green and alive<br /> Pulling me, pushing me</p>
<p>And then thereâ€™s a liberating<br /> Vivacious beat<br /> That arouses a crazed dance from within<br /> Moving to an enveloping sound</p>
<p>There I am<br /> I find myself on the edge of freedom<br /> On the verge of rectification<br /> On the end of that journey, idea, steep drop</p>
<p>And I find myself<br /> Feeling gratitude towards the experience<br /> For it has made me voracious<br /> To be on that edge<br /> Of the beginning</p>
